# RatCamp Trivia

### [Live Version](https://ratcamp-demo.herokuapp.com)

## Summary
A message board and chat social interface built using Node.js and powered by Heroku. The back-end of our platform uses Express and Socket.io to route messages exchanged with clients via sockets and delivers them to the appropriate recipients. User account integration is serviced by MongoDB. In addition to providing public and private chat rooms, the app also supports a limited number of commands denoted by messages beginning with an exclamation mark to indicate special functionality from the server.

## Commands
- `!trivia X` - start a game of trivia with `X` questions
- `!stop` - stop the current game of trivia
- `!leaderboard` - display the all time leaderboard
