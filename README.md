# RatCamp Trivia

### [Live Version](https://ratcamp-demo.herokuapp.com)

## Summary
An online chat interface with a built-in trivia game that can be played in public or private chat rooms. The app is powered by Heroku and was built using Node.js and a MongoDB database for user account integration. The back-end of our platform uses Express and Socket.io to route messages exchanged with clients via sockets and delivers them to the appropriate recipients. In addition to providing public and private chat rooms, the app also supports a limited number of commands denoted by messages that begin with an exclamation mark.

## Commands
- `!trivia X` - start a game of trivia with `X` questions
- `!stop` - stop the current game of trivia
- `!leaderboard` - display the all time leaderboard
