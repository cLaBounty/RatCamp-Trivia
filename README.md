# RatCamp Trivia

### [Live](https://ratcamp-demo.herokuapp.com/)

## Summary
A message board and chat social interface built using Node.js and powered by Heroku. Using Express and Socket.io, the back-end of our platform routes messages exchanged with clients via sockets and delivers them to the appropriate recipients. User account integration is serviced by MongoDB. In addition to providing public and private chat rooms, the app also supports a limited number of commands denoted by messages beginning with an exclamation mark to indicate special functionality from the server such as the starting and stopping of trivia games to be held either in public or private chat rooms.
